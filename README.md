# Next.js 15 Unhandled Page Rendering Error

This repository demonstrates a common error scenario in Next.js 15 where an unhandled error during page rendering can lead to unexpected behavior or a poor user experience. The problem arises when an error is thrown within a page component's rendering logic, causing the application to crash or display a generic error message without providing developers with clear insights into the root cause.

## Bug Description

The `about.js` page intentionally throws an error. In a production environment, this would lead to a broken user experience or potentially cryptic server error messages.  Next.js 15's error handling in this scenario may not be entirely intuitive for developers.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing proper error boundaries within the Next.js application to catch and handle such errors gracefully, providing a more user-friendly experience and valuable debugging information.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.  Observe the error behavior.
5. Check out the solution branch to see the fixed version.
